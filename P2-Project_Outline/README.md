# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project (tentative name "BeenThere") will be a digital travel journal that will allow a user to see a map of the world, drop "pushpins" in places they have been, and log information about their experiences in that place, including date(s), location(s), people traveled with, details, and pictures.

This project was motivated by the desire of the members of the group to have a way to log experiences and connections with friends and family in order to revist and reminisce about the past, either alone or with others.

### Features
RED:
- Create and edit logs: Users will be able to create new logs with a mixture of required (location, date) and optional fields (details, people traveled with, pictures, etc).
- User login/authentication: Users will be able to create accounts and log into the application. Each user will have a unique profile and map.
- Delete logs: Users will be able to delete logs or trips.
- Use cloud service to get images.
- Use modal windows and keep map in background.

YELLOW:
- Shareable link: Users will be able to generate a shareable link to their map that can be shared with others.
- Comments on Logs: Non-users will be able to add comments to user logs.
- View timeline of logs and trips: Users will be able to view a listing of all logs and trips, ordered by date (either most recent or least recent).
- Search: Users will be able to search for logs containing given text. 

GREEN:
- Group logs together into trips: Users will be able to group a set of logs together into one trip (ex: logs in Italy, Spain, and France may be grouped together into a trip of Europe).
- Rich text editing

### What I'll Have to Learn
Since the basis of the application is a map, we will have to learn about the Google Maps public API, specifically the Geocoding API. We will also have to learn how to upload images and text to the application.
